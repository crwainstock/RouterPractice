# Van Life React Router Practice

This full-stack application was built as I worked through the Learn React Router 6 Scrimba course. The app was built to explore new features of React Router 6.

## Purpose

This app is meant to allow users to search van listings. It also allows van owners to manage their listings through the host dashboard. The app is not fully functional in the following ways:

- Users cannot actually rent vans - the button on the van listing pages doesn't do anything currently.
- Hosts cannot update, add, or delete van listings through the dashboard.
- Hosts cannot view actual data in their dashboards (since it doesn't exist yet, the data is hard coded).
- Users cannot create new accounts or update their accounts as the app exists currently. Authentication and authorization are not built into the app in a sustainable way.

## Getting Started

- npm install in 'Van Life' folder
- npm start to run app in browser

## Deployed App

You can see [the app deployed with Netlify here](https://singular-souffle-d09f73.netlify.app/).
